TODO:
	- Add more modules (proper eval string, random text enc, random quoting, gross unicode ($'\u0063'), etc...)
	- Add option for string replacements and varname replacements
		-> Option to encode string list (would be slower)
	 	-> Uglier varname replacements (ie. unicode invisible to basic editors)
	- Better progress status (current version is hacky)
	- In pl1_shrink:
		-> Make the preparation a LOT faster (pattern matching? also rethink using read)
			-> shrink seems much slower on cygwin (might be read call)
		-> Add checks for strings/literals
		-> Use or remove the infnc flag
		-> Collect function names for better command recog
